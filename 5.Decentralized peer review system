## Decentralized peer review system for reviewers ##

Project Leads: Cleven

Abstract
Decentralized Peer Review System is an innovative DApp (Decentralized Application) designed to streamline and democratize the peer review process for academic and professional publications. The platform leverages blockchain technology to ensure transparency, security, and immutability of review records. This system allows reviewers to evaluate submissions anonymously, while authors benefit from unbiased and constructive feedback.

Features

Decentralized Platform: Built on blockchain, ensuring tamper-proof and transparent records.
Anonymity for Reviewers: Preserves anonymity to promote unbiased reviews.
Tokenized Incentives: Reward reviewers with cryptocurrency tokens for their contributions.
Reputation System: Reviewers build a decentralized reputation score based on their reviews.
Smart Contracts: Automates the submission, review, and payment processes.
Open Access: Ensures all published reviews and accepted works are openly accessible.
Technologies Used

Blockchain: Ethereum or Polygon (or chosen network) for decentralization.
Frontend: React.js, Web3.js
Backend: Python with Flask/Django
Database: IPFS for decentralized storage
Authentication: Wallet-based authentication using MetaMask or WalletConnect
Smart Contracts: Written in Solidity for Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatibility
Hosting: IPFS for front-end, with a blockchain node for backend
